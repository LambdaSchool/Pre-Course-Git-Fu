 * Git - Version Control - A system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
 * Clone - A copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.
 * Fork - A personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account.
 * History - A graph of snapshots of the entire repository.
 * Staging - You have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
 * Remote - The version of something that is hosted on a server
 * Commit - An individual change to a file (or set of files).
 * Push - The act of sending your committed changes to a remote repository.
