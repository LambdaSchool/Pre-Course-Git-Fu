## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A git repository is used to store code and manage a project.
 * Git - Version Control - The Git version control is used to track changes in files.
 * Clone - The git clone command is used to copy an existing repository. it has its own history and manages its own files.
 * Fork - A fork is a copy of a repository and it allows you to play around with the code without affecting the original project.
 * History - The git view history is when you want to go back to your code and see what changed after you've created several commits or if you are contributing on someone else's project and want to see what that person has written or changed.
 * Staging - Before you commit your files, you first have to move the file/files to the staging area. It's like telling the command line that your files are ready to go live. 
 * Remote - It's the place where your code is stored.
 * Commit - The Git commit command records the changes that you have made in your code.
 * Push - The Git push command is used to publish your most recent local commits on a remote server.
