## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a place where your source code resides.
 * Git - Version Control - a program that keeps track of source code and changes to a repository, and for coordination among other developers.
 * Clone - a cloned repository is just a copy of the original repository.
 * Fork - a request for GitHub to clone the project and registers it under your username.
 * History - the history of changes made to a repository
 * Staging - staging happens when youre preparing to commit the changes youve made to the source code
 * Remote - is a repository that is elsewhere other than your local machine that you would like to pull or commit to.
 * Commit - when a repository is commited github compares the source code of both the master branch and the forked or cloned repository on your local machine and checks for changes.
 * Push - updates the remote repository
