# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a directory or folder containing all project files and version of its files.

 * Git - Version Control - Git is a version control software that prevents overwriting of project files through forking (process of making a copy of the file and making changes to the copy), committing (keeping a record of different changes made) and merging (applying those changes to the master branch through pull requests).

 * Clone - a local copy (version) of a repository.

 * Fork - a personal copy (version) of a repository.

 * History - all changes made in the repository or versions (copy) of that repository. 

 * Staging - process where one makes changes to a file before committing it.

 * Remote - types of repositories hosted on the internet or network somewhere. 

 * Commit - changes made to a file or a set of files on Git/Github. Contains a message where one can put a brief description of the changes they made. 

 * Push - sending committed changes to a remote repository.
