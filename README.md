 * Git - Version Control - A system for tracking changes made to files, and coordinating those working on said files.
 * Clone - A copy of the repository.
 * Fork - A separated copy of a repository, where changes/experimenting may be done without affecting the master file.
 * History - A reference of files that have been modified.
 * Staging - A list of modified files, awaiting push to the repository.
 * Remote - A place where the code is stored.
 * Commit - Record of changes to the repository
 * Push - Pushes commits from local to the repository.
