## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A repository is a directory containing all of the files that make up a software package. They contain each file's revision history and there can be multiple collaborators.
 * Git - Version Control - Tracks changes of software life cycle
 * Clone - Clones a repository so that changes can be made locally
 * Fork - Branches a repository whereby a repo comes under another user's control within his/her account. Pull requests can be made to request the parent repo adopt the changes made in the forked repo.
 * History - All changes made to a repo
 * Staging - A branch of a repo used prior to production
 * Remote - Refers to a repo on the github server not locally
 * Commit - Prepares changes to be pushed to the Github server
 * Push - Pushes changes to the remote server

## Steps to our Lamba School Git Flow
1. Fork repository
2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL 
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
