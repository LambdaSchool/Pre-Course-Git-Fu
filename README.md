## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A place where files are stored/created in.
 * Git - Version Control - Allows multiple versions of the same repo to be used and modified without affecting the original repo.
 * Clone - Clone creates a copy from the repository to your local machine.
 * Fork - Copies a repository and adds it to your own github to change/modify it without affecting the original repo.
 * History - The changes you've made to the repository that is not in the original.
 * Staging - Prepares files to get commited.  
 * Remote - The local machine that you are using to change a repository.
 * Commit - Commit records changes you made, and gets it ready to be pushed to the remote repository.
 * Push - Pushes the commits made on the local branch to the remote repository such as github.
