## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - place where someone can put their collection of code/software
 * Git - Version Control - gits give you the efficiency to work on whatever version of code that you would like and to be able to incorporate it easily
 * Clone - allows you to grab a repository and make a new repository, letting you keep track of everything that goes on in the new repository in terms of forks, etc.
 * Fork - allows you to grab a repository in its current state and work on it yourself, picking up from where the creator/last forker left off and adding in your own work
 * History - allows you to see what has happened in the entirety of a repository's lifetime
 * Staging - a staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes in small commits
 * Remote - manage the set of repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track.
 * Commit - record changes to the repository ("commit to these changes")
 * Push - updates remotes along with associated objects
