# Pre Course Git Fu

 * Repository - collection of files, info - lives on GitHub
 * Git - Version Control - a way to make a variety of changes without messing up the master, also for multiple people to be working on something without overwriting 
 each other's work
 * Clone - make a copy of the master on your own machine
 * Fork - make your own copy of a repository - lives on GitHub
 * History - all of the changes made in the version
 * Staging - getting new changes ready to push back to the master
 * Remote - the version of the repo that lives somewhere else
 * Commit - store your new changes into the git history
 * Push - send changes back to your repo
