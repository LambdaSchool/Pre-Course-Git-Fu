## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - stores metadata for a group of files.
 * Git - Version Control - a way for you and your peers to save changes to a project without interfering with each others work.
 * Clone - copies a repository online and pastes its content into a newly created (local) directory.
 * Fork - a copy of a repository which is independent from the original.
 * History - tracks the changes made to the files being tracked.
 * Staging - a place to add file changes which you are going to commit.
 * Remote - a repository that is not on your local drive, but online, like on GitHub.
 * Commit - makes a record of changes made to your local repository.
 * Push - sends the committed changes on your local repository to your remote repository.
