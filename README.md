## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - file storage location
 * Git - Version Control - Used to allow individual team members to work on a project at the same time without overwriting the master copy
 * Clone - Locally-hosted copy of the master
 * Fork - The act of copying the master into your repository
 * History - Shows previous activity
 * Staging - Stores locally-made changes
 * Remote - Your machine where you edit your clone
 * Commit - Saves locally made changes to your repository
 * Push - Publishes locally-made changes to you repository

## Steps to our Lamba School Git Flow
1. Fork repository
2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL 
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
