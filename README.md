## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - stores all project files
 * Git - Version Control - monitors changes within files
 * Clone - copies repository to local machine
 * Fork - creates your own copy of a repository
 * History - list of commits
 * Staging - marks commits within file as ready to commit
 * Remote - repository that is on a server rather than local
 * Commit - changes within a file that can be tracked
 * Push - submit changes to remote repository

## Steps to our Lamba School Git Flow

2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL 
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
