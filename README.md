# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A repository is a digital representation of a programs file system that is available for review and changes.
 * Git - Version Control - a system that records edits to a file and saves previous edits in memory to revert to if needed. Multiple people can interact with uploaded files at the same time. 
 * Clone - To create a copy of a repository file that is local to your machine and stored to your personal devices memory. 
 * Fork - A copy of a repository that is stored online in your github profile, you can interact with the files and submit pull requests to merge the file with the master file. 
 * History - The traces of a repositories revisions are available for users to  manipulate. 
 * Staging - Staging is prepping files before allowing them to be commited to the respository. Staged files can be overwritten easily and unstaged prior to committing. 
 * Remote - Versions of your repository that are hosted on the internet instead of solely on your local machine. 
 * Commit - To record the changes you have made to a file in your local repository.
 * Push - To publish the committed changes to your remote repository file.
