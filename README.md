## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a project's public or private folder, with logs 
 * Git - Version Control - track and merge text files without corruption
 * Clone - copy of a repo that lives on your device instead of the online owner repo
 * Fork - copy of a repo that lives in your own online repo instead of the owners
 * History - status of the file after clone and before push
 * Staging - step before commit
 * Remote - version hosted that isnt the main
 * Commit - process to change a file(s), with log info 
 * Push - send committed changes to online repo
