 * Clone - A command or action used to copy a 'git repository' into a local machine.
 * Fork - A copy of a repository, alows for development without directly affecting the source repository.
 * History - A graph 'git commits' or 'snapshots' of the entire repository.
 * Staging - Process done before commiting a file, usually after changing the file, it must be staged before it is commited.
 * Remote - It is the URL of the location for the Git Project or Repository.
 * Commit - Records changes that were made to the repository.
 * Push - Updates the 'remote project' or repository with the changes that were 'commited' locally. Uploads the commited files to the online repository.
