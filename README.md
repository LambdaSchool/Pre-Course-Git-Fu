# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - The code found on GitHub
 * Git - Version Control - 
 * Clone - 
 * Fork - Branching off code from someone else's repository into your own. This clones it. It doesn't mess with there copy, only the one under my github name.
 * History -
 * Staging - Use git.add to bring something from red (non-clean, not staged) to green (staged so that changes will be committed)
 * Remote - 
 * Commit -
 * Push -
