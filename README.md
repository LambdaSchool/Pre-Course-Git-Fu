## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a directory, storage space or folder where you store projects. 
 * Git - Version Control - allows opensource collaboration of software development and prevents loss or overwriting of files.
 * Clone - copy of repo that is stored on your machine after you've forked from the master.
 * Fork - copy of master to your github account.
 * History - every time you commit, changes are saved in a sequential manner so you can access any point in time of the project at a later time. 
 * Staging - when you add files/changes using 'git add <filnename>' command (right before commit)
 * Remote - versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere
 * Commit - Saves the project into history enabling access to a specific version of the project at a later date if needed. 
 * Push - when you submit changes from your local machine to a remote repository (i.e. project repo in your github account)
