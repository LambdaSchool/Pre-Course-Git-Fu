 * Git - Version Control - A way of tracking changes made to your code
 * Clone - Making a local copy of a code repository
 * Fork - Creating your own version of a code repository to make changes to
 * History - The changes made to your code over time
 * Staging - The area where changes are collected before they are committed
 * Remote - How a local cloned copy is referred to, relative to the master copy
 * Commit - Marking a point where your changes are made
 * Push - Sending your changes to the master version.
