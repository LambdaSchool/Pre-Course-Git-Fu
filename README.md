## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - folder with all versions of all files that are part of the project to be worked on
 * Git - a distributed version control system
 * Version Control - a component of software configuration management that tracks and manages changes that are made to documents
 * Clone - to make a repository containing the revisions from another repository
 * Fork - to take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it
 * History - a continuous log of commits that tells how the software has changed
 * Staging - marking a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot
 * Remote - versions of your repository which are on another system
 * Commit -records changes to the repository
 * Push -pushes changes to the remote repository
