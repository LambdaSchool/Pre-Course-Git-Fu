# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A repository is a set of commit objects.
 * Git - Version Control - Version control keeps track of changes so that if mistakes are made you can go back to a previous version.
 * Clone - Clone is to make a local or remote copy of a repository.
 * Fork - Fork is a type of copy that allows a person to make changes to someone's project without affecting the original code. They are usually used to propose changes or starting points for ideas.
 * History - History is the log of changes made in a repository.
 * Staging - This is preparing and organizing a commit.
 * Remote - Version that is hosted on a server.
 * Commit - A change to a file that has a record of what changes were made and who made them.
 * Push - This is sending the changes to your repository that is hosted.
