## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a folder in which all of a project's files are located and can be accessed by collaborators
 * Git - Version Control - the practice of tracking the changes made to files and the different versions of files; Git is a program that enables for this tracking
 * Clone - a copy of a file that is stored on an individual collaborator's local machine, instead of a server
 * Fork - a copy of a file that is stored on a collaborator's GitHub account, which can be edited without affecting the original copy
 * History - a record of the changes made to the original by a collaborator
 * Staging - the process of reviewing the changes made to the version control file in a clone and cleaning the history before committing any changes
 * Remote - describes the files that are hosted on a server, versus the files stored on an individual collaborator's computer
 * Commit - saving changes made to a file and recording those changes for version control
 * Push - uploading a file with changes to a repository, like one on GitHub, for review

3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
