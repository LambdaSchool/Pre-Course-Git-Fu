## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - Data structure for storing information regarding your project's file history and related commits.
 * Git - Version Control - A distributed version control system that tracks changes made to project files.
 * Clone - A distributed copy of a repository stored locally.
 * Fork - A distinct copy of a repository where changes can be made without impacting the master. 
 * History - Displays changes to a project, specifically commits.
 * Staging - Files that have been modified and added to a list that are to be pushed to the repository.
 * Remote - A remote repository where the project is stored.
 * Commit - Commits save and track changes you have made to a project, they help record the history of changes made to a repo.
 * Push - You 'push' your changes to a repo. This is the act of sending all local commits/changes to the remote repo.
