## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - "Repo" for short, it's a directory where you can store and access your project, files and all the versions that have been saved.
 * Git - Version Control - It's for tracking changes in files and coordinating work among multiple people.
 * Clone - This command will copy an existing repository.
 * Fork - This is a copy of a repository, and like here this allows me to make changes to my version of a repo.
 * History - Commit history allows you to see all that has happened to a repo over time since the first commit.
 * Staging - This is a step before the commit process. 
 * Remote - This is where the code is stored typically on a hosted service like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab etc. However you can also run your own version on your own servers if you'd like. GitLab has a nice way of going about this.
 * Commit - This records changes to the repo, and is done right before you're ready to push your changes.
 * Push - This is used to upload local content to the remote repo.
