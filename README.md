## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - Whree all your hard work goes, projects, readmes, code files
 * Git - Version Control - A way of keeping track of your work without needing to create multiple instances of the same file
 * Clone - A download of a repo off a hub, such as GitHub
 * Fork - Really, a clone of a specific branch of the repo... really....
 * History - What has been committed and can be compared against other commits/updates to files
 * Staging - You can see what has been changed and what you might want to commit/add/push based on what files have been updated
 * Remote - Your local repo
 * Commit - When you make your changes known to Git, locally
 * Push - Making those changes known to your hosted repo and uploading those changes to be available to be pulled from on the web to the origin/master
