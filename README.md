## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A collection of commits, and branches and tags to identify commits.
 * Git - Version Control - A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
 * Clone - A local copy of a repository.
 * Fork - A copy of the master repository.
 * History - Shows a timeline of commits made.
 * Staging - The staging area stores information about what will go into your next commit.
 * Remote - Repositories other than the one on your local disk which you can push your changes into.
 * Commit - A command that records changes to the repository.
 * Push - Pushes changes made in your local branch to a remote repository.
