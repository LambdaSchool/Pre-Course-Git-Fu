# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - Like a folder, where git stores data structures
 * Git - Version Control - system to track changes in files & to coordinate work
 * Clone - copies the git folder/repository
 * Fork - copy of the repository, which you can then clone on computer to make changes
 * History - snapshot of changes in folder, like a log
 * Staging - step before commit , like git add  
 * Remote - where code is stored -(url) git remote  
 * Commit -  record of changes to repository, after stage
 * Push - actually updates the remote location
