## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A location block that stores deveolpment files/projects and other data that allows other users can have access as well. Many users can edit the data but the repository prevents the oringal data from being changed by others.
 * Git - Version Control - Tracks of all changes made in files. Keeps copies of every single detail about who changed it, why they changed it, and what they did to change it.
 * Clone - A copy of a repository on your local machine.
 * Fork - A copy of a repository on GitHub in the cloud.
 * History - The entire history of the repository 
 * Staging - Edits saved in you cloned respositories on your local machine that are waiting to be committed.
 * Remote - A copy of a cloned respository you have edited and saved and stored back into the cloud.
 * Commit - Are updates that record all changes that have been staged to the repository on your local machine. All commits get added to the history.
 * Push - Are final updates that record all changes done to the remote repository stored in the cloug.
