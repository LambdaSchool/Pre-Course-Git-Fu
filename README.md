# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - stores all of the project files and revision history. This is where the project initially lives.
 * Git - Version Control - Git is an open source program for keeping track of changes in text files. Version control is a system that records changes to a files allowing you to revisit specific versions in the future.
 * Clone - a copy of a repository that lives on your remote rather than a server.
 * Fork - allows you to copy a repository from another user's to your account.
 * History - chronological listing of revisions that have been made to a file or set of files.
 * Staging - preparing file or set of files for a commit.
 * Remote - your local machine.
 * Commit - a single change to a file. Like saving a file in word, but except with Git, it creates a unique ID for each save so you can safely view them later if needed.
 * Push - sending the committed changes to destination repository.
