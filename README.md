# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - Is your project folder. It stores all your project's files, versions, and documentation.
 * Git - Version Control - Tracks changes in files.
 * Clone - Copies a project to your own computer so you can work offline.
 * Fork - Makes a copy of a project under your account, so you can make changes to it.
 * History - Shows all the changes to each file in a project.
 * Staging - Sets up files that you want to be added or changes in a project.
 * Remote - Projects hosted on sites like GitHub
 * Commit - Saves your changes to a file but also makes a unique ID for that change for the version history.
 * Push - Sends your files to a remote repository.
