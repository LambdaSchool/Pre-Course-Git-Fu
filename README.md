 * Clone - Allows a person to copy a repository into a directory.
 * Fork - A copy made of existing files in a repository that is independent from the original repository.
 * History - A record of committed changes to repository files.
 * Staging - Marking a changed file to be committed to a git repository.
 * Remote - Versions of a project that are stored on the Internet or another network allowing for project collaboration from people residing wherever.
