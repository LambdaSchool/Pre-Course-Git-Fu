## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A place for all the files of a project, like a folder.
 * Git - Version Control - A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions of files can be recalled later.
 * Clone - Creates a new directory that clones a repository and is isolated from that repository.
 * Fork - A clone of a repository used for proposing changes to the original repository.
 * History - The tracked changes from one commit to the next. 
 * Staging - The step before the commit command in git, which readies the files to be committed. Files can still be changed if they are in the staging area.
 * Remote - A command that allows a name to be used instead of a url to a repository, like a bookmark.
 * Commit - A command that adds
 * Push - Updates the remote repository using the local one.
