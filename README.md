## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a digital directory where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves
 * Git - Version Control - is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people
 * Clone - is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone of the target
 * Fork - a copied repository that you can freely experiment with or change without affecting the original project
 * History - Where the project's state and changes are documented
 * Staging - Is a step before the commit process in git
 * Remote - Is basically a bookmark for a different repository from which you may wish to pull or push code
 * Commit - Records changes to the repository
 * Push - Updates remote refs along with associated objects
