## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository -  it is like a project's folder with files and there revision history
 * Git - Version Control - Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that we can recall specific versions later
 * Clone - to get a copy of an existing Git repo creating a local copy of the code
 * Fork - copy of a repo
 * History - all the commits to the project
 * Staging - step before the commit process, staged files can be edited
 * Remote - stuff that hosted on an other than local server
 * Commit - an individual change to a file or set of files
 * Push - send the committed changes to a remote repo
