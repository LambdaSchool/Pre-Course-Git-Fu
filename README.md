# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - a place where software is stored 
 * Git - Version Control - records changes to a file(s) so that you can recall version later 
 * Clone - target an existing repository and copy it 
 * Fork - copy of a repository
 * History - collection of all the different commits 
 * Staging - make changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes in small commits
 * Remote - versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere
 * Commit - Record changes to the repository
 * Push - Update remote refs along with associated objects
