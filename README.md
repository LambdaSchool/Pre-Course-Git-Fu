## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - it is where your file/s being stored.
 * Git - Version Control - it is one of the most popular version control tools that programmers/software engineering organizations use for their projects or codebases.
 * Clone - downloads the existing remote repository to your local computer.
 * Fork - is the act of copying a repository which allows you to work on and modify that forked repo without messing it up.
 * History - all of the previous commits to your project.
 * Staging - your file is waiting and ready to commit. 
 * Remote - repositories that are not on our local computer are referred as remote repos and they are hosted somewhere, usually online like at Github.com
 * Commit - record changes to the repository.
 * Push - uploads or "pushes" all the commits to the origin (remote repo)
