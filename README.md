## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A repository is like a folder for your project that contains the project files and revision history.
 * Git - Version Control - System that records changes to files over time.
 * Clone - creating a copy of a git repository.
 * Fork - copy of a repository that allows you to experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
 * History - Git stores history as a graph of snapshots called Commits.
 * Staging - The step before the commit process in Git.
 * Remote - Basically a bookmark for a different repository from which you may wish to pull or push code.
 * Commit - or "revision" is an individual change to a file or set of files.
 * Push - Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a local repository.
