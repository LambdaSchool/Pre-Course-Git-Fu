## Terms for learning Git

* Repository - . A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history.
* Git - Version Control - Tracks changes in files or repositories.
* Clone - A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy.
* Fork - A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account.
* History - Snapshots of an entire repository.
* Staging - Preparing a file for a commit
* Remote - Your own local computer
* Commit - A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
* Push - Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository, such as a repository hosted on GitHub.
