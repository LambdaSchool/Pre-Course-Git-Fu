## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - A collection of files and items related to a project.
 * Git - Version Control - A workflow tool allowing multiple people to work on a repository without damaging the integrity of that master repository; changes can be made by multiple people but can only be merged from the master repo.
 * Clone - Copies a repo/remote repo to download it to another locality of choice.
 * Fork - Making a copy of the master repo to a remote.
 * History - A log of hard saves/commits made to the local repo.
 * Staging - Before committing, adding files desired to be committed.
 * Remote - An instance of a master repo.
 * Commit - A hard save on a local repo.
 * Push - Updating changes made on local repo to the remote.
