 * Clone - downloading a copy of the repository to your local machine
 * Fork - copying the master branch of the repository to your own github account
 * History - a log of each commit made, tracks changes made to your code over time
 * Staging - adding a new file to your git repository, pre-commit
 * Remote - a repository stored elsewhere, on the internet or a local netowrk. a url used to access a repository remotely
 * Commit - saving changes made to your local clone of the repository, preparing for a push
