 * Clone - a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere
 * Fork - a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account
 * History - a list of all the changes made to the repository
 * Staging - a simple file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit
 * Remote - the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub
 * Commit - an individual change to a file (or set of files)
 * Push - sending your committed changes to a remote repository
