# Pre Course Git Fu

## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository - is used to organize a single project. It can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets. 
 * Git - Version Control - a system that keeps track of every change to a file over time so early versions can be restored and are used by software teams for source code.
 * Clone - a method to copy a repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.
 * Fork - is a copy of a reposity. It allows someone to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
 * History - is a log of changes made to the directory.
 * Staging - is process of preparing a file to be committed.
 * Remote - versions of the repository that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
 * Commit - changes that are saved to the local repository.
 * Push - a command to publish commits made on your local branch to the repository.
