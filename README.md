 * Clone -creating a local copy of the code provided by the developer.
 * Fork - a copy of a repository. Allowing to freely make changes without affecting the original file. 
 * History - developmental branches that can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.
 * Staging - stage between the working directory and the git directory.
 * Remote - the address to the repository
 * Commit - to save the changes made in repository
