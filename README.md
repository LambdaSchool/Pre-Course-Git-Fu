## Terms for learning Git
 * Repository -  a collection of files for a project, like the file folder on your computer except it is stored on a server so everyone can access it.
 * Git - a program for tracking changes made to files
 * Version Control - a system of recording changes so you can access different versions at a later date
 * Clone - a copy of a repository that lives on your computer
 * Fork - a personal copy of a repository that lives on your account so changes can be made without affecting the original
 * History - a record of the various updates and changes made to a repository
 * Staging - getting a file prepared to send back to the main repository
 * Remote - a version that has been saved to a remote server ie GitHub and can connect to clones so changes can sync
 * Commit - a revision or saved version of the files
 * Push - sending your changes back to the repository

## Steps to our Lamba School Git Flow
1. Fork repository
2. `git clone` w/ the repository URL 
3. After Changes Made: `git status`
4. `git add <file-name>` 
5. `git status` to check what is staged
6. `git commit -m 'made changes to the Readme'`
7. `git push`
